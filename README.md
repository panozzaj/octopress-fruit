I got the base of this theme from [Bill Patrianakos's Spartn Theme](https://github.com/billpatrianakos/spartn) for Octopress.

Usage:

To install:

```
rake 'install[path/from/.theme/directory]'
```

To upgrade an existing install (when you have tweaked something):

```
rake update_source[path/from/.theme/directory]
```
